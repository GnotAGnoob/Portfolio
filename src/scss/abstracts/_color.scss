//1) YOU SHOULD NOT USE THESE COLORS DIRECTLY, OWN VARIABLES
//ARE DECLARED IN THEME SECTION!! AND USE THOSE INSTEAD, reason is easier theming theming.

//2) if you have only 2 or more values the sass function in root
//will automatically generate between colors gradually
//so put the whitest as 50 and darkest as 900 and the mid as 500
//for the best results and time savings use 3 variables

//3) use slate instead of gray unless some reason
